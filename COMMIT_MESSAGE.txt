feat: implement comprehensive health check support for Envoy clusters

üéâ MAJOR RELEASE: v1.0.0 - Production-Ready Health Check Implementation

## ‚ú® New Features

### Health Check Support (HTTP/TCP/gRPC)
- Added complete health check API types in xdscontrolplane_types.go
- Implemented HTTP health checks with custom paths, headers, and status validation
- Added TCP health checks with Base64 binary payload support
- Implemented gRPC health checks with service name and authority config
- Configurable timeouts, intervals, thresholds, and connection reuse

### Real Envoy Integration
- Successfully tested with Envoy proxy v1.28
- Full xDS v3 protocol compatibility verified
- Binary data handling for TCP health checks validated

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Controller Enhancements
- Added buildHealthCheck, buildHTTPHealthCheck, buildTCPHealthCheck, buildGRPCHealthCheck functions
- Integrated health check processing into cluster building logic
- Fixed critical TCP health check bug (Payload_Text ‚Üí Payload_Binary)

### Testing Infrastructure
- Added 26 comprehensive unit tests for all health check types
- Created Docker Compose integration testing environment
- Real backend services (nginx HTTP, Python TCP) for validation
- Automated integration test script

## üìö Documentation & Examples

### New Documentation
- docs/healthcheck.md - Complete health check configuration guide
- docs/integration-testing.md - Real Envoy integration testing guide
- Updated README.md with health check examples and modern documentation
- CHANGELOG.md - Project version history

### Sample Configurations
- config/samples/xds_v1alpha1_xdscontrolplane_healthcheck.yaml
- test-configs/ - Integration testing configurations
- docker-compose.yaml - Multi-service testing environment

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing
- 26 unit tests covering all health check scenarios
- Edge cases and error condition testing
- Default value validation
- Base64 encoding verification

### Integration Testing
- Real Envoy proxy v1.28 testing
- Multi-service Docker environment
- End-to-end configuration flow validation
- Health check delivery verification via config_dump

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical TCP Health Check Fix
- Issue: Envoy rejected TCP health checks with "invalid hex string" error
- Root Cause: Used Payload_Text instead of Payload_Binary for binary data
- Solution: Implemented proper binary payload handling
- Result: TCP health checks now work perfectly with Base64 encoded data

### Port Conflicts Resolution
- Fixed operator metrics port conflicts (8080 ‚Üí 8082)
- Resolved XDS server port binding issues
- Network connectivity improvements for Docker integration

## üìä Impact

### Production Readiness
- ‚úÖ All health check types fully implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Real Envoy proxy integration validated

This release establishes the XDS Control Plane Operator as a production-ready 
solution for managing Envoy proxy fleets with advanced health monitoring 
capabilities. The implementation has been thoroughly tested with real Envoy 
instances and is ready for enterprise deployment.
